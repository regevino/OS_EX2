REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Q1:
An example for usage of user-level-threads can be parallelized algorithms which divide
batch jobs into several segments in order to decrease run-time. In such a case decreasing
the context switch overhead would be a priority while there will be little risk of one
thread blocking the others.

Q2:
Advantages:
Creating a new process for each tab increases security by preventing tabs from accessing other
tabs' resources.

Disadvantages:
Creating a new process for each tab increases the overhead for opening a new tab and increases
memory usage overhead.

Q3:
Whenever we type in the shell an I/O interrupt is sent from the keyboard and passed by the OS
to the shell. When we type "kill pid" the OS passes the SIGTERM signal to the process with
that id.

Q4:
The 'virtual' time is the time in which the thread itself was running, whereas the 'real'
time is the real time that passed on the system including OS intervention,
context switches etc.
